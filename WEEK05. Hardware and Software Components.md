This week, we will learn about the hardware and software components that make up an XR system.

# Learning Objectives:
- describe common hardware components in XR devices
- explain the image formation process in typical XR HMDs
- describe common software components in immersive applications
- describe the architecture of a typical WebXR application

# Lectorial

I know CNY :tangerine::tangerine: is not over yet, but we'll need to resume our face-to-face classes this week :)

## Pre-class Material
You should start with our YouTube video at https://youtu.be/OKD4jrnn4WE . 
The video is also available as an audio Spotify/web podcast at https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/sZ0kg0FqVwb.

As usual, read the video/podcast descriptions and go through the linked URLs auxiliary content as necessary to fill in any gaps in your understanding. The Stanford slides are especially helpful if you want all the detailed math on computing the rendering matrices.

As usual, it will be helpful to go through some of the auxiliary content as necessary to fill in any gaps in your understanding of the main content mentioned in our video.

# Lab

I will first discuss common issues faced by teams in crafting your RQs.

In the remaining time, you should work on the TP in your teams. We will "visit" your teams as usual. Please aim to tell us:
1. what you have done last 2 weeks
2. what's planned for the next week
3. any issues you need our help with

Just as before, create a `team-progress-week05.md` file in your team repo and update it with the above information.

Some of your mentors may not be physically present in the lab this week, so the file will aid in their asynchronous review of your progress.
