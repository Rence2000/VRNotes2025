I am posting this early for the üêç CNY Week üçästarting 27 January 2025.

This is a week dedicated to getting up to speed with the development environment we chose (WebXR through Babylon.js) as the vehicle for translating your immersive designs to implementation.

# Learning Objectives:

- setup programming environment for building web-based XR applications
- implement a complete WebXR application with a simple 3D scene
- understand the basic components of a WebXR application using BabylonJS

# Lectorial 

Our class (on Thu) coincides with the CNY holidays so we will have **self-learning activities this week** instead of ftf classes.

You should firstly go through the Self-study Materials below.

Then complete the self-paced formative quiz on xsite titled "WEEK04 Formative Quiz". This quiz is set on the xSITe platform so that you can get a feel of the quiz platform we will use for the assessed Quizzes.

Then complete the Lab below.

We will also be available in the Centre for Immersification lab (UI/UX Studio, E2-08-13 SIT@PG) for consultation on anything related to this weeks tasks on Fri (since Thu is a holiday) over lunch time (11-2pm).

## Self-study Materials

Start by reviewing the edited recorded live coding session at https://youtu.be/iDCnmggNIy8 . 

Note that this video is rather lengthy so please make full use of the chapter markers. We've also tried to remove redundant conversations and condensed the lengthy parts, but it is a recorded live stream nevertheless. 

This week is totally self-learning, so the saved time from attending the missed lectorial can be used to watch this long video :) .

Live coding always incurs some live debugging as well, which we've kept (but in fast-forwarded fashion). Feel free to slow down at those parts if you find them useful. Otherwise you may want to watch most of the parts in at least 1.5x speed.

# Lab

This week, you will work on the first lab (IPA1) with regards to implementation tasks in this module. These labs will be part of your Individual Programming Assignments (IPA) and will be released on GitHub Classroom.

In fact, since we have already released the lab some time ago, we see that many of you have already completed the lab, which is great!

You will need to submit the IPA1 by the end of this week.

If you're done with IPA1, we urge you to work on the TP. Do remember that you can loan or use the devices in the Centre for Immersification (UI/UX Studio) for the purposes of your TP: https://github.com/orgs/sit-dia/discussions/6

We will be available asynchronously on the GitHub organization's discussions page to answer any questions you have on the lab tasks. As mentioned earlier, we will also be available in the lab for consultation on anything related to this week's tasks on Fri over lunch time (11-2pm).

# WEEK04 Formative Quiz

The serves as a trial quiz for the summative quizzes, i.e.,the formally-assessed QUIZ01 and QUIZ02 where grades will be recorded.

The format of this quiz will be very similar to QUIZ01 and QUIZ02 which is tentatively planned in WEEK06 and WEEK13 respectively.
- administered through the lockdown browser
- you can access some whitelisted URL domains but any links you click that leads out of those domains won't work

Look out for the quiz in the xSITe LMS from 27 January 2025.
