# Learning Objectives:
- differentiate AR, VR, MR and XR
- explain Milgram and Kishino's Reality-Virtuality Continuum
- describe the historical evolution of immersive technologies 

(this means that at the end of this week you should at least be able to do the things listed above) 

# Lectorial
Most lectorials are face-to-face.
For this first session, you can just come without preparation. However do note that future lectorials will mostly include some self-study content.

The slides used during the lectorial will only be available after the class. This is because it is integrated with an in-class formative quiz so we can only release the questions after the class.

The lectorial quizzes are formative, meaning they wonâ€™t impact your grades directly. However, to make things a bit more exciting, students who can attain the top leaderboard position across 2 weeks by the end of the semester will receive a 1% bonus added to their final grade. While itâ€™s a small reward, the goal is to introduce a little friendly competition and boost your engagement with these formative quizzes! ðŸ˜Š

Another important thing is that we will use the names on the quiz platform as attendance for the classes. So please make sure you **use your full real name when you join the quiz platform**. If you do not wish to reveal yourselves during these formative quizzes, you can choose to use your SIT student ID instead. We are doing this to reduce the hassle of taking attendance manually, so we'd appreciate your cooperation on this.

## Post-class Material
You are encouraged to read the paper after class. It was the one referenced in class and provides a great overview of the RV continuum and how it applies to modern day XR.
