This week is an implementation-focused week where we will learn how immersive virtual environments are typically created, through some practice in WebXR as usual.

# Learning Objectives:
- create a 3D virtual environment with a skybox and geometric primitives in WebXR
- implementing a simple GUI in an XR application
- implement anchors to overlay 3D virtual objects in camera video in WebXR
- implement basic audio in WebXR applications 
- differentiate model-based vs image-based methods to create virtual environments

# Lectorial 

We will have the usual face-to-face classes this week.

## Pre-class Material

Start by reviewing the edited recorded live coding session at https://youtu.be/9crXku_K-0Y . 

As with previously recorded live streams, this video is rather lengthy so please make full use of the chapter markers. We've also done the usual of scrubbing through the entire video to remove redundant conversations and condensed the lengthy parts, but it is a recorded live stream nevertheless. 

Live coding always incurs some live debugging as well, which we've kept (but in fast-forwarded fashion). Feel free to slow down at those parts if you find them useful. It may be tough to watch this video in 1.5x speed as the audio was rather bad this time (blaming the room :) since we were unable to use the lab during that recording). We apologize for that.

# Lab

## QUIZ01

There is of course QUIZ01 that is also happening this week during the lab hours. Details are at:
https://github.com/orgs/sit-dia/discussions/13 . 

In the remaining time let's focus on the TP.

We will "visit" your teams as usual. Please aim to tell us:
1. what you have done last week
2. what's planned for the next week
3. any issues you need our help with

Just as before, create a `team-progress-week06.md` file in your team repo and update it with the above information.
