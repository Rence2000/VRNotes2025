#  Learning Objectives
- explain Milgram and Kishino's Reality-Virtuality Continuum (rolled over from WEEK01)
- explain immersion as system properties
- explain immersion as user experiences
- explain the key dimensions of presence, flow and cybersickness
- describe how to employ different quantitative and qualitative user research methods to evaluate presence, flow and cybersickness
- explain the role of affordances in immersive experiences

(we will keep things flexible and adjust the coverage based on the pace of the class)

# Lectorial 
The class will be held face-to-face as usual and starting this week, you should come prepared by going through the pre-class material.

## Pre-class Material
You should start with our YouTube video at https://youtu.be/zNpo3Ue2Ui0 . 
The video is also available as an audio Spotify/web podcast at https://anchor.fm/immersification/episodes/Developing-Immersive-Applications-Evaluating-Immersive-Experiences-e1ssguj .

Next, you should go through the linked URLs below (also in the video/podcast descriptions). You may not finish everything this week but all these are meant to be reference material for your further understanding. Minimally for this week, you should go through the first 2 links (video and paper for the cited VR locomotion research), and at least look at the abstracts of every paper below.

# Lab
This is the first lab and most labs are face-to-face. Labs will primarily serve to help you progress in your IPA or TP work.

We will first briefly go through the first lab assignment (IPA1) repo that you should've accepted.

The next important task is to form your groups and start reading the Team Project details in:
https://github.com/orgs/sit-dia/discussions/4

Then we will have a role play user study of some XR artifact. The goal is to let you experience the role of an XR user study participant to 
1. get a feel of how typical XR user study procedures are structured, as well as 
2. to experience the thought processes of participants when they fill in the immersion-related questionnaire instruments

This will arm you will the required knowledge for your own user study as part of the Team Project.

In the remaining time, the most important admin task you need to complete is to get your team processes in place
1. join the same team in the "Team Project" assignment: https://classroom.github.com/a/OIShX3q5
2. and do some brainstorming
