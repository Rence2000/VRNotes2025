This week, in the lectorial, we aim to get acquainted with some common tools for developing immersive applications. In the lab, we will continue to familiarize ourselves with the ways you can evaluate immersive experiences for your TP.

# Learning Objectives:
- describe common tools for developing immersive applications
- differentiate the accessibility implications of choosing different types of tools
- differentiate WebXR and OpenXR standards
- differentiate key experiential constructs for measuring immersion
- differentiate between quantitative and qualitative user research methods used in evaluating immersive experiences

# Lectorial 

The lectorial will be face-to-face as usual.

## Pre-class Material

As usual, start by watching our immersification lab video on Development Tools: https://youtu.be/jpsDhyNasz4

The video is also available as an audio Spotify/web podcast at https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/immersification/episodes/Developing-Immersive-Applications-Development-Tools-e1tfvb1

Then go through some of the auxiliary content (as listed in the video/podcast descriptions) as necessary to fill in any gaps in your understanding of the main content mentioned in our video (e.g., read up on WebXR and OpenXR)

# Lab

This is something we did not manage to do in the last lab, but will be helpful for your TP.
We will do a role-play user study of some XR artifact. The goal is to let you experience the role of an XR user study participant to 
1. get a feel of how typical XR user study procedures are structured, as well as 
2. to experience the thought processes of participants when they fill in the immersion-related questionnaire instruments

This will arm you will the required knowledge for your own user study as part of the Team Project.

Then you should aim to work in your teams during the lab timeslot, and we will be "visiting" the teams to understand your progress. Please aim to tell us:
1. the roles of each team member
2. how you plan to assign and track tasks
3. what is the main communication channel you will use
4. how you plan to deal non-contributing team members
5. what have you done last week
6. what's planned for the next 2 weeks
